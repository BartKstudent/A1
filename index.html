                Personal Information
            </h2>
            <p>
                I have been a first-generation Polish immigrant in Australia for over 6 years and speak English and Polish fluently. I had the pleasure to live, learn and work in Poland, England, Sweden and Australia (where I plan to build my future). In the last 5 years I have been in management and sales positions as an employee in fitness industry, while running my own personal training business and as far as it is from IT, it’s close to my heart as I used to be overweight in my childhood and teenage years, before going through my personal transformation. I have changed my lifestyle thanks to mixed martial arts, which have become my passion over the years, and I intend to keep competing until the body says “no more”.

            <h2>
                Interest in IT
            </h2>
            <p>
                My interest in IT has begun when I was about 7 years old when we bought our 2nd PC and moved the old one to grandparent’s apartment. Until then my access to the computer has been quite restricted, but once I had unlimited to the old machine I did play around with it and broke it for the most part as a 7 year old with no experience would, but grandparent’s neighbour who was a few years older was a computer nut and I asked him for advice on how to fix my issues and quite soon I knew how to use control panel and install Windows, which at the time felt like a mastery of Computer Science. Periodically I have experimented with new things, like HTML and CSS, but only 2 years ago I have decided to commit to making it my career. I have finished my Cert II in Computer Assembly and repairs in December 2018, afterwards I began self-study of Python on Codecademy and my dual qualification Cert IV in IT and Cybersecurity in 2019. Looking at the market requirements I decided to move on to obtain a bachelor’s degree. Due to busy lifestyle I had to take up an online course and the RMIT offer popped up as the best choice. Unfortunately due to complications caused by the global pandemic I had to pull out of the course very early and ended up starting a workflow automation business with my business partner and recently signing to the very same course to further expand my knowledge.

                To me the results are very accurate in all cases. The first test indicates that I am an <strong>"Architect - INTJ-A"</strong>characterised by individualism and constant analysis of practically every aspect of life and environment. It is a very rare personality that likes privacy, honesty, truth and rationality. Being assertive and unwavered by opinions of others it's in my opinion a great mindset to achieve goals. The second test indicates a tactile learning type, which gets the most out of their learning through practice. I believe that it's the best learning style for "INTJ", because "Architects" want to utilize their skills practically, be a credible expert or lead with an example. The third test was a verification of numerical reasoning, which in my case is 10/10 for this test. The results are a confirmation of my capabilities for logical thinking and Math skills.

                In my experience there are positives and negatives when it comes to teamwork for my personality type:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Intuitive Learning</strong> - Being able to learn fast is a great asset in a team, as I don't need much training, before taking on full responsibilities and can support fellow team members. It is also a downside as communicating terse instructions which seem obvious to me are not always clear to fellow teammates.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Introverted Personality</strong> - As an introvert I prefer to focus on my tasks and keep my workflow, which moves collaborative work forward, however that also means that once distracted by others, it takes me some time to get back into the flow of work.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Thinking Type</strong> - Preferrence of planning and analysis over going with the feeling is a great way to have any idea worked out to the finest detail, but sometimes little details are not as important and that overanalysis and drilling team with questions can slow down everybody's work.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Quick Judgment</strong> - Being able to make a quick judgment in a high-paced environment is very handy to keep the workflow, however that is often based on preconceived ideas, which can cause people like me to judge their team members to harshly in certain matters. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Assertiveness</strong> - Speaking my mind confidently to team members and the boss is a great asset in communication and helps build rapport with all stakeholders, the only downside is that sometimes important comments from others may be dismissed too early.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Tactile Learning Style</strong> - I like to learn on the job, which is a standard in our competetive economy and allows me to rise to or reach beyond the team's expectations. Learning through practice also means preference of explaining through practice, which might not be suitable when explaining new processes to others, as well as more time consuming.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Great Maths Skills</strong> - Every job requires some sort of mathematical abilities and having a team member that can manage their own always makes it easier on the rest of the teammates.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                When forming a team I should take into account strengths and weaknesses of my personality, tasks required, as well as synergy between the entire team. For example if I were to open my own gym, I would need to manage it personally and start small with a team of 5 people max. In this environment, I would be looking for a loyal and smart trainer who I can communicate with clearly, to promote him later to an assistant manager when the gym starts growing, as well as a charismatic, outgoing, honest trainer who would take care of members and boost their motivation. If I were to manage an IT project with a team of 10, I would be looking for loyal, hard-working introverts, who prefer to focus on work.
