                Personal Information
            </h2>
            <p>
                I have been a first-generation Polish immigrant in Australia for over 6 years and speak English and Polish fluently. I had the pleasure to live, learn and work in Poland, England, Sweden and Australia (where I plan to build my future). In the last 5 years I have been in management and sales positions as an employee in fitness industry, while running my own personal training business and as far as it is from IT, it’s close to my heart as I used to be overweight in my childhood and teenage years, before going through my personal transformation. I have changed my lifestyle thanks to mixed martial arts, which have become my passion over the years, and I intend to keep competing until the body says “no more”.

                Interest in IT
            </h2>
            <p>
                My interest in IT has begun when I was about 7 years old when we bought our 2nd PC and moved the old one to grandparent’s apartment. Until then my access to the computer has been quite restricted, but once I had unlimited to the old machine I did play around with it and broke it for the most part as a 7 year old with no experience would, but grandparent’s neighbour who was a few years older was a computer nut and I asked him for advice on how to fix my issues and quite soon I knew how to use control panel and install Windows, which at the time felt like a mastery of Computer Science. Periodically I have experimented with new things, like HTML and CSS, but only 2 years ago I have decided to commit to making it my career. I have finished my Cert II in Computer Assembly and repairs in December 2018, afterwards I began self-study of Python on Codecademy and my dual qualification Cert IV in IT and Cybersecurity in 2019. Looking at the market requirements I decided to move on to obtain a bachelor’s degree. Due to busy lifestyle I had to take up an online course and the RMIT offer popped up as the best choice. In this course I want to consolidate my fragmented abilities, while acquiring further skills and knowledge needed for successful career as an IT professional.
