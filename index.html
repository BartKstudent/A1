                Personal Information
            </h2>
            <p>
                I have been a first-generation Polish immigrant in Australia for over 6 years and speak English and Polish fluently. I had the pleasure to live, learn and work in Poland, England, Sweden and Australia (where I plan to build my future). In the last 5 years I have been in management and sales positions as an employee in fitness industry, while running my own personal training business and as far as it is from IT, it’s close to my heart as I used to be overweight in my childhood and teenage years, before going through my personal transformation. I have changed my lifestyle thanks to mixed martial arts, which have become my passion over the years, and I intend to keep competing until the body says “no more”.

            <h2>
                Interest in IT
            </h2>
            <p>
                My interest in IT has begun when I was about 7 years old when we bought our 2nd PC and moved the old one to grandparent’s apartment. Until then my access to the computer has been quite restricted, but once I had unlimited to the old machine I did play around with it and broke it for the most part as a 7 year old with no experience would, but grandparent’s neighbour who was a few years older was a computer nut and I asked him for advice on how to fix my issues and quite soon I knew how to use control panel and install Windows, which at the time felt like a mastery of Computer Science. Periodically I have experimented with new things, like HTML and CSS, but only 2 years ago I have decided to commit to making it my career. I have finished my Cert II in Computer Assembly and repairs in December 2018, afterwards I began self-study of Python on Codecademy and my dual qualification Cert IV in IT and Cybersecurity in 2019. Looking at the market requirements I decided to move on to obtain a bachelor’s degree. Due to busy lifestyle I had to take up an online course and the RMIT offer popped up as the best choice. Unfortunately due to complications caused by the global pandemic I had to pull out of the course very early and ended up starting a workflow automation business with my business partner and recently signing to the very same course to further expand my knowledge.

                To me the results are very accurate in all cases. The first test indicates that I am an <strong>"Architect - INTJ-A"</strong>characterised by individualism and constant analysis of practically every aspect of life and environment. It is a very rare personality that likes privacy, honesty, truth and rationality. Being assertive and unwavered by opinions of others it's in my opinion a great mindset to achieve goals. The second test indicates a tactile learning type, which gets the most out of their learning through practice. I believe that it's the best learning style for "INTJ", because "Architects" want to utilize their skills practically, be a credible expert or lead with an example. The third test was a verification of numerical reasoning, which in my case is 10/10 for this test. The results are a confirmation of my capabilities for logical thinking and Math skills.

            <p>
                In my experience there are positives and negatives when it comes to teamwork for my personality type:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Intuitive Learning</strong> - Being able to learn fast is a great asset in a team, as I don't need much training, before taking on full responsibilities and can support fellow team members. It is also a downside as communicating terse instructions which seem obvious to me are not always clear to fellow teammates.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Introverted Personality</strong> - As an introvert I prefer to focus on my tasks and keep my workflow, which moves collaborative work forward, however that also means that once distracted by others, it takes me some time to get back into the flow of work.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Thinking Type</strong> - Preferrence of planning and analysis over going with the feeling is a great way to have any idea worked out to the finest detail, but sometimes little details are not as important and that overanalysis and drilling team with questions can slow down everybody's work.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Quick Judgment</strong> - Being able to make a quick judgment in a high-paced environment is very handy to keep the workflow, however that is often based on preconceived ideas, which can cause people like me to judge their team members to harshly in certain matters. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Assertiveness</strong> - Speaking my mind confidently to team members and the boss is a great asset in communication and helps build rapport with all stakeholders, the only downside is that sometimes important comments from others may be dismissed too early.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Tactile Learning Style</strong> - I like to learn on the job, which is a standard in our competetive economy and allows me to rise to or reach beyond the team's expectations. Learning through practice also means preference of explaining through practice, which might not be suitable when explaining new processes to others, as well as more time consuming.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Great Maths Skills</strong> - Every job requires some sort of mathematical abilities and having a team member that can manage their own always makes it easier on the rest of the teammates.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                When forming a team I should take into account strengths and weaknesses of my personality, tasks required, as well as synergy between the entire team. For example if I were to open my own gym, I would need to manage it personally and start small with a team of 5 people max. In this environment, I would be looking for a loyal and smart trainer who I can communicate with clearly, to promote him later to an assistant manager when the gym starts growing, as well as a charismatic, outgoing, honest trainer who would take care of members and boost their motivation. If I were to manage an IT project with a team of 10, I would be looking for loyal, hard-working introverts, who prefer to focus on work.

            <h3>
                Overview
            </h3>
            <p>
                This will be an automation system that allows gyms and personal training studies sign up enquiries via Internet or over the phone and send them on a digital onboarding journey without delay caused by manual processing. Signed up members will have immediate access to exclusive membership area filled with educational material, workouts, and general health guidance. Their data will automatically be added to existing CRM used by business and subscribed to regular direct debit payments outlined during sign up process. Member’s will be automatically subscribed to gym’s newsletter mailing list to stay up to date with any changes and events at their training facility.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Motivation
            </h3>
            <p>
                According to (Heather Sarantis, 2002) statistically we have an upward trend of paper use in businesses worldwide. That creates a situation, where businesses are less sustainable, less efficient, and less profitable, as the time goes by. The main goal of this project is to generate a positive effect for the business, the client, and the environment by allowing the company to move to paperless solutions that are more effective, more user friendly, much easier to access and less time-consuming. By creating efficient workflow automation, we can achieve all of these goals, for a much lower price in a timely manner.

                        <strong>Enquiry management</strong> – any enquiries coming through the Facebook ads, etc. will be automatically added to CRM database using existing Zapier integrations or custom Webhooks (if API is available for the CRM platform). Enquiry details will also be forwarded to relevant sales staff for follow-up. The sales team will then call the lead and use the phone sales forms (point 2 and 3) to go through the sales process.

                        <strong>Phone Sales (Admin Side)</strong> – when committing to a phone sale the sales representative will use an online form containing the sales script and form fields where the team member can submit answers from the prospect. This way the staff can easily follow the script and build rapport while at the same time collecting information about the new sign up. Upon submission of the form the data will get updated in the CRM or sent to relevant staff for processing.

                        <strong>Phone Sales (Client Side)</strong> – as part of the phone sales process the prospect will get a 3-stage form to collect their Terms and Conditions acknowledgement, personal data, payment details and point of sale referrals.

                                <strong>Terms and Conditions step</strong> – this step will ask for first name, last name email and contain a simple overview of terms and conditions followed by link to full Ts&Cs, acknowledgement tick box and submission button. Submission of the form will create a PDF containing the full terms and conditions and that the acknowledgement has been confirmed electronically by “First Name” “Last Name” with “Email” from “IP Address”. That Paperwork will be automatically emailed to both parties and to the CRM. Client will then be taken to the next form.

                                <strong>Client Details step</strong> – this step will be used to collect more personal data, such as mobile number, address, any existing health conditions, and payment details. Upon submission the data will be transferred to CRM, new membership will be created, and automatic direct debit plan set up. Both parties will get email confirmation of the submission, as well as automatically generated PDF outlining the provided information and membership package chosen. New login credentials will be created for the membership site and automated text with this information will be sent to the member.

                                <strong>Point of Sale Referral step</strong> – in this step new client will have the option to refer up to 3 people they know for a free 1-week trial at the facility. If any data is provided in this step sales staff will be sent an automated email with referral details. Whether data is provided or not, client will be taken to a “Thank You” page with outline of next steps.

                        <strong>Online Sales</strong> – this will be available for anyone who is interested in signing up directly via website. This will be very similar to the Phone Sales (Client Side), but with a bit more information to guide them through the process. This can also be used on a tablet for a face to face sign-up in the facility.

                Skills Required
            </h3>
            <p>
                For the presented project we need a great understanding of Web Development, use of HTML, CSS programming language(s) required to build custom Webhooks if necessary (the language will depend on the CRMs APIs, Python seems to be a viable option in most scenarios). Since we are using a lot of existing software, we will need strong understanding and experience of all required tools and the ability to adapt, in case client wants to use an alternative software.
